Angular Vienna Rethinking Reactivity
Alex Rickabaugh, Angular Core lead, spoke at the ngGl√ºhwein in Vienna. He presented a Plan v2 for the Signals. Initially, the plan was to come out with Signal components very quickly, actually already in Angular 17.

The Angular team realised that it might be a too huge step, especially if an Angular application comes with a lot of libraries that also have to be migrated.

So, the updated plan includes smaller steps. We might already get Angular 17 Signal-based inputs for the normal component; after that comes the possibility of a partial zoneless component with OnPush Change Detection strategy. Then, Signal Components and then finally, the long-awaited and high-performant Signal Change Detection.
