signals represent synchronous values that can change over time. They're not really a good fit for 
HTTP responses, which are more like async values that resolve at some point (Promises / Observables).

use RxJS where it provides value for you, and use 
signals to communicate your state to the template

The v16 developer preview of signals doesn't include any support for zoneless change detection. It integrates signals into the current change detection story - they can be used to drive OnPush components as an alternative to the async pipe, for example.

Signal-based components, signal inputs, zoneless change detection, etc. are planned for a future release.



Signal represents a value (value stream, synchronous)

Observable represents an event (event stream, asynchronous)

Thank you for your excellent AMA.
You stated:
"SolidJS is a framework built explicitly around signals."
Why Angular do not use SolidJS as a library, kind of similar to Angular is using RxJS as a library?
What is the difference between Angular's signals and SolidJS's signals?

RxJS libraries

I refactored one of my existing Angular applications that relied heavily on RxJS and observables, to signals.

see branches signal and signal-rxjs-interop
the signal occurs as a so-called producer.
If the consumer is the data binding, it can bring the changed values into the component. Changed Components can thus be updated directly.
a signal always has a value by definition. Therefore, a default value must be passed to the signal function.
